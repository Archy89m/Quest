This application is the final project of module 3 - Java Professional.
All mandatory requirements for the use of technologies and business logic requirements have been fulfilled.

The application development utilized technologies such as JSP, JSTL, Servlets, CSS, and JUnit.

The application has a simple structure but offers significant scalability possibilities.
Its main feature is that quests are loaded from YAML files without the need to add additional code for each new quest. This means that a person without IT development skills can create a quest, which is an advantage when adding new content.

The main configuration settings used for testing the quest launch were:

Server:

Application server: Tomcat 9.0.87
Browser: Google Chrome
URL: http://localhost:88/
HTTP port: 88
Deployment

Deploy at the server startup: Quest:war exploded
Application context: /
Before launch: Build 'Quest:war exploded' artifact
